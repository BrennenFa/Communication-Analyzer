 Hey guys, it's Kayla back with another video. Okay, so first things first is I haven't been getting like a lot of views or whatever on my videos, so if you guys could share like with your friends and stuff, I would really, really appreciate it. Okay, so the topic of today's video is being yourself and it's like, you know, well, aren't I always being myself and like, yeah, for sure, but sorry, I'm reading these off paper, okay, but it's like being yourself is like not changing yourself to impress someone else, you know, cause like you could be the most popular kid at school or like, you know, like have like the hottest boyfriend or whatever, but like, what's the point if you're not being yourself? And it's like being yourself can be hard and like the hard part about being yourself is that it's not always easy because you know, like people can like make fun of you or something dumb cause like people suck and evil people exist, but you just kind of ignore them and like not care what they're saying. And like for instance, like, you know, a lot of people like call me quiet or shy or whatever, but I'm not quiet. Like I, you know, I don't talk a lot at school, but I just, it's not like I'm scared to not talk. I just don't want to, but if like people actually, you know, like be my friend or like, you know, talk to me and stuff, they'd find out that I'm like really funny and cool and talkative. And yeah, I'm just, I'm not like quiet. I just choose not to talk a lot at school, like other people, you know? Okay, so yeah, I hope to basically, you know, like be yourself and don't care about like whatever, what other people think about you and just like, you know, ignore them if they're being mean to you about it and everything will work out if you're just being yourself. Okay, thank you guys for watching this video. I hope some of you guys found it helpful and make sure to subscribe to my channel. And yeah, thank you for watching. Gucci. Thank you.
